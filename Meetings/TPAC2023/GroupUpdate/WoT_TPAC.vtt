00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.023 
Hello, welcome to the introduction video of Web of Things

00:00:09.023 --> 00:00:14.427 
Since you came across this video, we assume that you heard a bit about

00:00:14.427 --> 00:00:19.830 
the Web of Things and Thing Description. But let us give a brief introduction.

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.591 
First, let's talk about the difference between IoT and WoT.

00:00:24.591 --> 00:00:32.645 
While IoT focuses on technologies for connecting devices to the Internet, WoT leverages IoT and aims

00:00:32.645 --> 00:00:40.699 
to provide interoperability between Things using established architectural ideas for the Web and web technologies.

00:00:40.699 --> 00:00:45.630 
So lets talk about a Thing and Thing Description.

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:51.178 
In the WoT Architecture, a Thing is defined as an abstraction of an

00:00:51.178 --> 00:00:56.726 
IoT device or service. And TD provides descriptive metadata for a Thing.

00:00:56.726 --> 00:01:02.662 
WoT provides a set of standardized technology building blocks that help to

00:01:02.662 --> 00:01:08.598 
streamline IoT application development by following the well-known and successful Web paradigm.

00:01:08.598 --> 00:01:16.276 
With the architecture enabled by the Web of Things, flexibility and interoperability increases, especially

00:01:16.276 --> 00:01:23.954 
in cross-domain applications, as well as enabling the reuse of established standards and tools.

00:01:23.954 --> 00:01:30.670 
If you want to learn more, we are developing a tutorial series called “What is WoT?”

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:39.072 
Throughout this tutorial series, we will explain the Web of Things, its applications and tools for newcomers.

00:01:40.604 --> 00:01:44.395 
This is to learn WoT and speed up the learning process.

00:01:44.393 --> 00:01:49.652 
Each video is short, so you can learn WoT bit by bit.

00:01:49.652 --> 00:01:54.886 
At any time, you can come back and use the videos as a reference.

00:01:54.886 --> 00:02:00.228 
This tutorial series is not only consisting of material to watch, but is also

00:02:00.228 --> 00:02:05.570 
supported with code snippets that you can work on and try by yourself.

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:12.516 
At the end of the series, you will have all the tools in your belt to build WoT applications.

00:02:12.516 --> 00:02:18.114 
With all these tools, you can build actual software such as dashboards,

00:02:18.114 --> 00:02:22.875 
protocol proxies and translators,

00:02:22.873 --> 00:02:26.190 
smart internet-connected devices,

00:02:26.194 --> 00:02:30.264 
mash ups of WoT devices and services,

00:02:30.264 --> 00:02:34.309 
in many domains such as Smart Homes,

00:02:34.309 --> 00:02:37.722 
and Factory Automation.

00:02:39.328 --> 00:02:45.993 
What can be achieved with the WoT is endless. We feel your excitement to learn and develop

00:02:45.993 --> 00:02:52.657 
the WoT applications If you are ready to dive into world of WoT, let's start this journey!

00:02:52.657 --> 00:02:59.020 
For the rest of the series, make sure to follow the W 3 C WoT Community Group,

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:03.600 
And we have multiple options to stay in touch with Web of Things:

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:06.224 
You can join the Discord server.

00:03:06.224 --> 00:03:13.340 
You can find how companies use WoT via the presentations on the YouTube channel.

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:18.502 
Also you can join one of the office hours happening every Thursday.

00:03:18.502 --> 00:03:24.013 
You can visit w3 dot org/wot to learn more about WoT. If

00:03:24.013 --> 00:03:29.524 
you want to contribute you can join WoT community group too.
