ege: joint meeting with the CG
... Cristiano should be joining
... starting with brief updates
... trasnparency of the work
... then Plugfest and Liaison

subtopic: What dows the CG do?

ege: no plan for publishing specs
... no official agreement about docs
... but oranizing meetups
... put slides, etc., on GitHub
... video on YouTube also
... Tutorials also have been created
... e.g., underlying technology
... also office hours
... to discuss questions from external developers
... (shows "Updates from WoT CG" video)
... 5 tutorials, 10 meetups
... WoT Week
... Plugfest
... various target areas
... different industry categories
... opensource collaboration
... join the community!
... the video summarizes the CG's activity
... (What works well)
... Meetups have 20+ attendees
... tutorials get reviews and watched regulerly
... (shows channel view information)
... some are more popular than others
... DT's AI topic is popular
... questions?

seb: how many from the WoT main page?
... e.g., the ones from the WoT marketing page

ege: 30000
... pretty good number
... (shows videos listed on YouTube)

ege: (What does not work well)
... office hours
... ok in the beginning
... but i the worst case, simply used as a chairs call
... monthly calls
... very low numbers and not motivated to work on CG tasks...
... maybe need more "concrete" tasks?
... created the "Adopters page", though
... a "starter" page can be created

ege: (Plugfest Organization)
... as mentioend yesterday
... possibly the WoT IG would be closed
... possibly move Plugfests to the CG side

ege: (Liaison)
... discussion during TPAC in Sevilla

-> https://github.com/w3c/wot-cg/pull/227 wot-cg PR 227

-> https://github.com/w3c/wot-cg/blob/bf7739043a14527678b94b7ea3ea8197b7217829/liaisons.md proposed liaisons.md

ege: proposed liaisons.md document about WoT WG collaboration
... e.g., around WoT Binding
... create a non-normative document to be submitted to the WG
... also topic on Plugfests

seb: just a proposal from the CG side

ege: right

seb: make sense to have discussion

daniel: just checked
... IG has 3 TFs
... what about Marketing and Use cases?

ege: possibly

seb: we talked about that yesterday as part of the WoT WG Charter topic
... Use Cases work can be moved to the WoT WG
... on the other hand, Plugfests would have external developers
... so make more sense for the CG to work on that, I think

daniel: ok, tx

seb: anything else?

cris: would support this direction
... wondering about the Marketing work like meetups

ege: Web site maintenance is the big part

cris: yeah
... so wondering about the possible collaboration about that

seb: Marketing on the WG side is hosted by the W3C officially
... on the other hand, the CG is differently managed
... but possible liaison to be discussed
... would initiate discussion on that

kaz: good direction
... wondering about how to proceed
... OK to have further discussion as part of the WoT WG Chartering?

ege: sure
... technically, some of the WG topics could be discussed by the CG
... in a non-normative manner

kaz: good point
... so we need to clarify the procedure about the relationship between CG and WG

seb: regarding the WoT WG Charter
... probably we would have less focused work for the WoT WG
... but that should not mean we (as the whole W3C) should stop discussion on the other topics
... e.g., JSON-LD guys also have been discussing how to work on which topics

mahda: wondering about the license

ege: CGs have their own license mechanism
... (mentions possible collaboration between a WG and a CG)

mahda: maybe the CG is not really interested in writing specs
... probably they're more interested in implementations
... WoT tooling could be a topic, though

ege: some of the CG participants might be interested

mahda: test files, schemas, etc.

ege: but difficult to split the tasks for testing in general
... maybe in some case, it might be possible, though

david: what about use cases work by CG?

seb: no, at the moment

david: we have factory manager, and if we reach out them
... it's just narrative, what is wished to have or hate to have
... what would make their lives better, etc.
... could invite them to the CG
... almost kind of like having one unique group
... could get very strong opinions
... we have to be sure
... facing to external people
... WoT solves offload problems
... but it's not a clear turnkey solution
... actually, node-wot is still kind of difficult to understand
... don't want to use websocket itself, etc.
... would see what external people really would like to have

ege: yeah
... but not sure how to do that...

cris: one comment
... one actual point here is markeing from my side
... explain the WoT landscape better
... I agree WoT for offloading approach
... opensource projects can get people as the necessary effort is less than others

ege: people have more...
... would like to know how to handle WoT?
... they describe their issues on their slides
... pipeline should be clarified

david: yes, pipeline to be clarified

cris: some companies don't allow people to make contribution to opensource projects
... should make the license easier

kaz: we can generate our proposal and then talk talk with the Team :)

david: we have the next step to simply the work
... some of us get together to clarify the current procedure
... we have to try
... we're actually losing participation due to "paper work"

(some discussion about opensource vs legal departments within companies)
(also some more discussion about how to promote the WoT work in general)

seb: wondering about the Plugfests

(some quick discussion about Plugfests)

ege: then that's it for today :)

seb: and I've already done our closing session ;)
... thank you very much for our 6-day meeting!!!

ege: enjoyed Karaoke much :)

seb: but still have October Fest, etc., in Germany
... both of then in Osaka, though
... anyway, thank you very much for your participation, all!
... no WoT meetings next week
... so see you all in 2 weeks

ege: note that there will be a meetup of the CG next week
