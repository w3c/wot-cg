00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:15.591 
This year, the W3C Web of Things community has continued to grow - reaching new domains and connecting more people,

00:00:15.591 --> 00:00:19.272 
devices, and ideas than ever before.

00:00:19.272 --> 00:00:23.342 
We’re excited to share some of our highlights with you.

00:00:23.342 --> 00:00:32.663 
Over the past year, we’ve seen incredible momentum across the community. We released five new tutorials, organized ten meetups and

00:00:32.663 --> 00:00:37.764 
our Discord community grew by more than 50%.

00:00:37.764 --> 00:00:45.414 
One of our biggest highlights was WoT Week - a dedicated event that brought the community together to share demos,

00:00:45.414 --> 00:00:51.110 
showcase implementations, and discuss what’s next for the Web of Things.

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:58.888 
These efforts and our meetups have brought together a diverse mix of contributors - from commercial teams and research groups

00:00:58.888 --> 00:01:02.547 
to independent developers and enthusiasts.

00:01:02.547 --> 00:01:12.705 
Together, they’re exploring the potential of Web of Things across different domains ranging from smart homes, building automation, scientific labs,

00:01:12.705 --> 00:01:15.499 
and industrial environments.

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:23.660 
At the heart of it all is open source - a model that encourages transparency and collaboration. It’s what enables

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:30.761 
the Web of Things to keep evolving through real contributions from people and organizations around the world.

00:01:30.761 --> 00:01:34.517 
As we look ahead, we’re excited to keep growing.

00:01:34.517 --> 00:01:40.555
