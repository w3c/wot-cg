Let's start this tutorial with a short introduction to the **Web of Things**.

## Difference Between IoT and WoT

To gain a grasp on the meaning of the Web of Things, it's important to first understand what the difference between WoT and IoT is. While IoT focuses on technologies for connecting devices to the Internet, WoT takes it a step further. It builds on IoT by making sure all these connected devices can work together seamlessly. This interoperability is achieved using established architectural ideas for the Web and web technologies.

## Thing Description

In the WoT Architecture, a Thing is defined as an abstraction of an IoT device or service. Correspondingly, a TD (Thing Description) provides descriptive metadata for a Thing. Some examples for what Things can be are computers, sensors, smart appliances and more.

## Web of Things in a Nutshell

WoT provides a set of standardized technology building blocks that help to streamline IoT application development by following the well-known and successful Web paradigm. With the architecture enabled by the Web of Things, flexibility and interoperability increases especially in cross-domain applications, as well as enabling the reuse of established standards and tools. What can be achieved with the WoT is endless.
