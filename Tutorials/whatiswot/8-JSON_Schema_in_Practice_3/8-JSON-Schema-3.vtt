00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.087 
In the previous videos of JSON Schema, we have explained the features and basic implementations of JSON

00:00:07.087 --> 00:00:14.175 
Schema. In this video, we will show the actual validation process with libraries and code examples.

00:00:14.175 --> 00:00:22.397 
Throughout this video, we will mainly focus on validation with the Python library jsonschema and the JavaScript library AJV,

00:00:22.397 --> 00:00:30.619 
but there are many other libraries in different programming languages and tools to validate JSON using a JSON Schema.

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:38.794 
Here are some of the popular ones in different programming languages. There are many more validators.

00:00:38.794 --> 00:00:45.757 
For further information, you can check the JSON schema homepage via the link in the video description.

00:00:45.757 --> 00:00:51.294 
This is the basic validation flow that all libraries follow.

00:00:51.294 --> 00:00:56.276 
The library takes a schema for your JSON data and validates your

00:00:56.276 --> 00:01:01.257 
data according to the schema. Outputs the validation result as a boolean

00:01:01.257 --> 00:01:06.307 
So let's start with AJV! It is a JavaScript library.

00:01:06.307 --> 00:01:14.344 
This is the same temperature sensor example we used before. Let’s examine this in JavaScript code.

00:01:14.344 --> 00:01:20.219 
First, We are importing the AJV.

00:01:20.219 --> 00:01:25.119 
This is the Schema that describes the JSON we are expecting.

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:33.244 
With this line of code, AJV takes schema as a parameter compiles it to function, and caches it.

00:01:33.244 --> 00:01:37.382 
This is the data to be validated.

00:01:37.382 --> 00:01:44.919 
Here we can see the validation step where the result is written into a boolean named isValid.

00:01:44.919 --> 00:01:53.676 
This step is for printing the result of the validation. If isValid is true, then it prints "JSON input is

00:01:53.676 --> 00:02:02.432 
valid according to Schema". Otherwise, it prints the "JSON input is not valid according to Schema" and the error message.

00:02:02.432 --> 00:02:09.207 
It outputs that input is valid since the data that we enter suits the predefined schema.

00:02:10.787 --> 00:02:16.568 
Now let's take a look at the same validation example but with Python's

00:02:16.568 --> 00:02:22.349 
jsonschema library. It is an implementation of the JSON Schema specification for Python.

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:29.399 
We will use the same temperature example that we use for AJV but for Python this time.

00:02:29.399 --> 00:02:32.724 
Let's take a look at the code in detail.

00:02:32.724 --> 00:02:39.012 
With this line of code, we are importing the function from the library.

00:02:39.012 --> 00:02:44.912 
This is the same schema in the previous example.

00:02:44.912 --> 00:02:49.799 
This is the data to be validated.

00:02:50.399 --> 00:02:57.456 
This validate function takes the data and the schema validates it and prints the result. If

00:02:57.456 --> 00:03:04.512 
the data is valid, it does not print anything. Otherwise, it prints the error message.

00:03:04.512 --> 00:03:09.718 
The code outputs that the data is not valid since the property "temperatureOf"

00:03:09.718 --> 00:03:14.924 
needs to be string. However, in the given data it is an integer.

00:03:14.924 --> 00:03:19.499 
This concludes the videos on JSON Schema.
