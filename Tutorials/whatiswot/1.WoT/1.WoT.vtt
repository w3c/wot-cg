00:00:04.889 --> 00:00:09.904 
Hello! Welcome to the "What is WoT" tutorial series.

00:00:09.918 --> 00:00:18.381 
Throughout this tutorial series, we will explain the Web of Things, its applications, and tools for newcomers.

00:00:18.381 --> 00:00:24.232 
We structured this tutorial series in two stages. First, introduce the concepts

00:00:24.232 --> 00:00:30.084 
from basics to advanced. Then, support them with demos and applications.

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:34.888 
This is to learn Web of Things and speed up the learning process.

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:40.327 
Each video is short, so you can learn Web of Things bit by bit.

00:00:40.428 --> 00:00:45.663 
At any time, you can come back and use the videos as a reference.

00:00:45.663 --> 00:00:50.846 
This tutorial series is not only consisting of material to watch but is also

00:00:50.846 --> 00:00:56.030 
supported with code snippets that you can work on and try by yourself.

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:59.731 
At the end of the series, you will have all the

00:00:59.731 --> 00:01:03.432 
tools in your belt to build Web of Things applications.

00:01:03.432 --> 00:01:10.208 
With all these tools, you can build actual software such as dashboards,

00:01:10.208 --> 00:01:13.501 
protocol proxies,

00:01:13.486 --> 00:01:18.018 
smart internet-connected devices,

00:01:18.018 --> 00:01:23.034 
mash ups of Web of Things devices and services,

00:01:23.031 --> 00:01:26.664 
in many domains such as Smart Homes,

00:01:26.664 --> 00:01:29.339 
and Factory Automation

00:01:29.339 --> 00:01:34.796 
Since you came across this tutorial series, we assume that you heard a bit

00:01:34.796 --> 00:01:40.253 
about the Web of Things and Thing Description. But let us give a brief introduction.

00:01:40.245 --> 00:01:44.076 
Before we explain Web of Things, lets first talk about the

00:01:44.076 --> 00:01:47.907 
difference between Internet of Things and the Web of Things.

00:01:47.907 --> 00:01:56.908 
While Internet of Things focuses on technologies for connecting devices to the Internet, Web of Things leverages Internet of

00:01:56.908 --> 00:02:05.908 
Things and aims to provide interoperability between Things using established architectural ideas for the Web and web technologies.

00:02:05.908 --> 00:02:09.214 
So lets talk about a thing and thing description

00:02:09.498 --> 00:02:13.159 
In the Web of Things Architecture, a Thing is defined as

00:02:13.159 --> 00:02:16.820 
an abstraction of an Internet of Things device or service.

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:21.533 
And Thing Description provides descriptive metadata for a Thing.

00:02:21.533 --> 00:02:28.392 
Web of Things provides a set of standardized technology building blocks that help to

00:02:28.392 --> 00:02:35.250 
streamline Internet of Things application development by following the well-known and successful Web paradigm.

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:42.582 
With the architecture enabled by the Web of Things, flexibility and interoperability increases especially

00:02:42.582 --> 00:02:49.914 
in cross-domain applications, as well as enabling the reuse of established standards and tools.

00:02:50.042 --> 00:02:56.919 
What can be achieved with the Web of Things is endless. We feel your excitement to learn and

00:02:56.919 --> 00:03:03.796 
develop the WoT applications If you are ready to dive into world of WoT, let's start this journey!

00:03:03.833 --> 00:03:10.380 
In the next video, we will talk about Payloads and Headers. If you already know the

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:16.927 
basics, you can skip the introduction and directly move to general Web of Things videos.
