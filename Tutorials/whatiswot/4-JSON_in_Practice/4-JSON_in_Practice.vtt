00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.211 
In the last video, we showed mostly primitive types of JSON. In this video, we will

00:00:06.211 --> 00:00:12.423 
first focus on arrays and objects, and then we will mention common mistakes when writing JSON.

00:00:12.423 --> 00:00:18.634 
At the end of the video, we will demonstrate the usage of JSON generation and parsing.

00:00:18.634 --> 00:00:23.522 
In JSON, each value in an array is called an item.

00:00:23.522 --> 00:00:29.184 
Arrays with items of different types are also allowed.

00:00:29.184 --> 00:00:35.624 
Nested objects are allowed in JSON. “measurement” keyword is an example of this.

00:00:35.624 --> 00:00:44.020 
Objects start and end with curly brackets. It is basically defining keywords and mapping these keywords to values.

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:50.818 
In this example, we define the name and value pairs to describe the data sent by sensors. Please add this sentence.

00:00:50.818 --> 00:00:59.031 
There is a JSON array of JSON Objects which means all items are JSON objects in that array.

00:00:59.031 --> 00:01:04.981 
Now we will talk about common mistakes while writing JSON files.

00:01:04.981 --> 00:01:09.093 
Let's start with the space character which is frequently overlooked.

00:01:09.093 --> 00:01:11.131 
Space is a character too.

00:01:11.131 --> 00:01:15.543 
So “is Active” is not the same as “is Active blank”

00:01:15.543 --> 00:01:20.257 
Also, JSON is case sensitive. Thus, "is Active" with upper case A

00:01:20.257 --> 00:01:24.971 
is not the same as “is active” with lower case A.

00:01:24.971 --> 00:01:31.224 
Paying attention to this is important to make sure that object assignments and comparisons work.

00:01:31.224 --> 00:01:35.749 
Lets continue with the mistakes about quotation marks.

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:41.624 
Forgetting quotation marks is wrong, it will show validation errors everywhere.

00:01:41.624 --> 00:01:46.162 
Also putting them when you should not cause unwanted results.

00:01:46.162 --> 00:01:52.662 
For example → “name”:”true” is not the same as “name”:true without quotation marks.

00:01:52.662 --> 00:01:58.012 
The first one is not a boolean but a string so it will be interpreted as a string.

00:01:58.012 --> 00:02:01.637 
The same problem happens with numbers too.

00:02:01.637 --> 00:02:08.137 
This way, the types will be incorrectly interpreted by your programming language.

00:02:08.137 --> 00:02:16.537 
Putting comments inside JSON documents is not valid.

00:02:16.537 --> 00:02:20.172 
Commas should not be used at the final name-value pair.

00:02:20.172 --> 00:02:24.453 
That is why the first one is not valid but difficult to see if

00:02:24.453 --> 00:02:28.735 
you are using it inside of a javascript editor rather than a JSON editor.

00:02:28.735 --> 00:02:35.413 
Similar to the previous one depending on the programming language that you use, syntax might differ.

00:02:35.413 --> 00:02:41.855 
Since JSON will be the object of that programming language before it is parsed and serialized as JSON.

00:02:41.855 --> 00:02:47.306 
For example, in JSON key-value pairs have to be with quotation marks whereas

00:02:47.306 --> 00:02:52.756 
in JavaScript files it is not necessary to have quotation marks, both work.

00:02:52.756 --> 00:02:56.093 
The syntax of the keywords might differ as well.

00:02:56.093 --> 00:03:01.982 
For example, true false keywords in JSON, Rust, JavaScript, and Golang are written lowercase,

00:03:01.982 --> 00:03:07.871 
while in Python the first letter of these keywords needs to be capitalized.

00:03:07.871 --> 00:03:14.208 
Similar to the previous one, the null keyword differs in JSON and Python.

00:03:14.208 --> 00:03:18.436 
In JSON and JavaScript it is null with lowercase while in

00:03:18.436 --> 00:03:22.664 
Python, the same meaning is given with the "None" keyword.

00:03:22.664 --> 00:03:27.561 
Open a code editor. In this example, we used VS Code.

00:03:27.561 --> 00:03:34.112 
Write a JSON file of your choice and save it by giving a file name and adding a .json extension.

00:03:34.112 --> 00:03:38.379 
Then the editor will recognize the file as a JSON document.

00:03:38.379 --> 00:03:45.073 
Now we will read a JSON file from the file system using a JSON library in Python.

00:03:45.073 --> 00:03:51.541 
We open the JSON file that we have previously saved to the file system with open-as-file key words.

00:03:51.541 --> 00:03:56.808 
Then, we can load that JSON file with the load function into the data object.

00:03:56.808 --> 00:04:00.502 
We can also print it to see what is inside the JSON file.

00:04:00.502 --> 00:04:07.201 
Printing the data object in console can look like this.

00:04:07.201 --> 00:04:12.673 
There are many ways to send a JSON file via different protocols, one of

00:04:12.673 --> 00:04:18.145 
them is using Python and its request library for sending an HTTP request.

00:04:18.145 --> 00:04:25.947 
With this library, you can use the post function to send an HTTP POST request with a JSON Payload.

00:04:25.947 --> 00:04:31.332 
As a parameter, it takes the URL to send to and the JSON object.

00:04:31.332 --> 00:04:36.955
