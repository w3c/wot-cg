## Liaisons to the W3C WoT Community Group

The liaisons of the W3C WoT CG are not explicitly outlined in the CG charter; however, they are documented in this document. 
This markdown document details each liaison and explains the extent of its scope.

Current liaisons:

- [Web of Things Working Group](#web-of-things-interest-and-working-group)

> [!NOTE] 
> The key words MAY, MUST, MUST NOT, RECOMMENDED, SHOULD, and SHOULD NOT in this document are to be interpreted as described in [BCP 14](https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/bcp14) [RFC2119](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2119) [RFC8174](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8174) when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here. 

### Web of Things Working Group

> [!NOTE] 
> This is only a draft until a resolution is reached in both WG and CG. These will be documented via email.
> The CG Charter MAY need changes to satisfy the liaison. Agreeing on this document implies agreeing on the corresponding CG Charter changes.

> The content below, until the horizontal line, is composed by the CG based on inputs from the TPAC Joint Meeting, CG Internal Meeting, and Office Hours inputs. Please refer to [Original Input](#original-input) for the discussion results from W3C TPAC 2023.

The WoT WG liaison is categorized based on the nature of collaboration. 
The categories below explain the scope of collaboration.

#### Binding Documents

The CG CAN work on bindings and submit to the WoT Binding Registry managed by the WoT WG.

The following rules are provided for convenience but they are mandated by documents outside of this one:

- The CG Bindings MUST adhere to the [W3C CLA](https://www.w3.org/community/about/process/cla/).
- The CG Bindings MUST comply with the format and content requirements established by the [WoT Binding Registry](https://www.w3.org/TR/wot-binding-registry/). 

#### Role of WoT CG

The role of the CG in this collaboration is categorized into three: facilitating a low entry barrier, engaging in outreach and bindings.

##### Ensuring a Low Entry for WoT Involvement

Considering the existence of membership fees for WG participation, fostering more participants to exchange ideas on WoT-related topics becomes relevant.

CG participants CAN actively and openly exchange ideas on WoT-related topics within the CG, collaborate on non-normative CG reports, and experiment with the implementations of the WG reports.

##### Outreach

The CG utilizes various channels under the CG co-chairs' administration to reach a broad audience interested in WoT, aligning with the low-entry barrier principle.

##### Bindings

The CG provides a place to develop bindings for people who cannot join the WG.
This is relevant if the "owner" of the protocol or the WG is not willing to write a binding for a protocol that a CG participant is interested in.
This creates an environment for collaboration, as well as public and stable URIs needed for the registry submission.

#### Plugfests

The CG organizes WoT Plugfests and invites WoT WG participants and other organizations.
The goal of the WoT Plugfest is to gather implementation experience, test interoperability between implementations, test new features of the WoT WG specifications and work on WoT Bindings, which can belong to WoT WG, WoT CG or other organizations.

Each Plugfest has its own folder and a wiki page in the CG GitHub.

#### Other events

Joint meetings, such as Face to Face (F2F) and TPAC meetings, MAY be convened between the WoT WG and CG.
