# Liaisons to the W3C WoT Community Group

The liaisons of the W3C WoT Community Group (CG) are not explicitly defined in the CG Charter.
However, they are documented in this document.
This document describes each liaison and defines the scope of responsibility.

Current liaison:

- [Web of Things Working Group](#web-of-things-working-group)

## Web of Things Working Group

In this section, WG refers to the Web of Things Working Group.
CG refers to the Web of Things Community Group.

> [!NOTE]
> This liaison is a draft until a resolution is reached in both the WG and CG.
> Resolutions will be documented via email.
> The CG Charter will need to be updated to satisfy this liaison.
> Agreement on this document implies agreement on the corresponding CG Charter updates.
> Until the revised CG Charter becomes active, this liaison remains in draft status.

This liaison defines the role of the CG with respect to the work of the WG.
The CG has four primary roles: facilitating a low entry barrier, conducting outreach, organizing plugfests, and developing bindings.

### Facilitating a Low Entry Barrier

The purpose of this liaison is to foster broader engagement and idea exchange on WoT-related topics.
CG participants can freely exchange ideas on WoT-related topics, collaborate on non-normative CG reports, and experiment with implementations of WG deliverables.
Additionally, the CG develops WoT tutorials to support newcomers in understanding WG reports, as well as open-source implementations of WoT.

### Outreach

The CG uses communication channels administered by the CG co-chairs to reach a broad audience.
This aligns with the low-entry-barrier objective.
These channels include, but are not limited to:

- A Discord server where discussions take place and events are communicated to the community
- A YouTube channel where tutorials and meetup videos are published
- (Online) Community meetup events where implementers can share their experience with WoT

### Bindings

The CG provides a venue to develop bindings for contributors who cannot join the WG.
This enables collaboration and supports the creation of public, stable URIs needed for registry submissions.
By no means is the development of bindings limited to CG participants.

The following requirements are mandated by external documents:

- The CG bindings must adhere to the [W3C CLA](https://www.w3.org/community/about/process/cla/) that each CG participant agrees to upon joining the CG.
- The CG bindings must comply with the format and content requirements established by the [WoT Binding Registry](https://www.w3.org/TR/wot-binding-registry/).

### Plugfests

The CG organizes WoT Plugfests and invites WG participants, external organizations, and individuals.
The goal of Plugfests is to gather implementation experience, test interoperability between implementations, test new features of the WG specifications, and work on WoT bindings.
These bindings may belong to the WG, CG, or other organizations.
Ideally, WG participants are involved in the organization of Plugfests.

Plugfests do not have the goal of creating an implementation report.
Implementation reports are required for the publication of W3C Recommendations.
This activity remains the responsibility of the WG.

Each Plugfest has its own folder and a wiki page in the CG GitHub repository.
